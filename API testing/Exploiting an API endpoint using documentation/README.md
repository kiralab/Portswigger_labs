## Solution :

Login as Wiener with the provided credentials - `wiener:peter`.

Now when we change the email of wiener, the browser sends the folowing `PATCH` request to `/api/user/wiener`

If we remove **user/wiener** & send the request, we get the REST API documentation.

Now we can delete the user carlos by sending a `DELETE` request to `/api/user/carlos`.
