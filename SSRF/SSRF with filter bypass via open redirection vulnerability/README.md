## Overview:

If the API used to make the back-end HTTP request supports redirections, you can construct a URL that satisfies the filter and results in a redirected request to the desired back-end target.

Suppose the application contains an open redirection vulnerability in which the following URL:

```http
/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=6&path=http://evil-user.net
```
returns a redirection to:

```http
http://evil-user.net
```

You can leverage the open redirection vulnerability to bypass the URL filter, and exploit the SSRF vulnerability as follows: 

```http
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://weliketoshop.net/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=6&path=http://192.168.0.68/admin
```

> The application then requests the supplied URL, which triggers the open redirection. It follows the redirection, and makes a request to the internal URL of the attacker's choosing.
