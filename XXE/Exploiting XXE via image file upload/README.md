## Overview :

#### XXE attacks via file upload

Some applications allow users to upload files which are then processed server-side. Some common file formats use XML or contain XML subcomponents. Examples of XML-based formats are office document formats like `DOCX` and image formats like `SVG`.

For example, an application might allow users to upload images, and process or validate these on the server after they are uploaded. Even if the application expects to receive a format like PNG or JPEG, the image processing library that is being used might support SVG images. **Since the SVG format uses XML, an attacker can submit a malicious SVG image and so reach hidden attack surface for XXE vulnerabilities**. 

## Solution :

The image upload functionality is vulnerable to XXE attack.

Since **SVG image formats are XML based, we can try to upload an SVG image & modify the content of the xml to retreive `/etc/passwd`.**

First step is to download any SVG image from the internet [LINK](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/NewTux.svg/32px-NewTux.svg.png)
