 ## What is a csrf token ?
 
 A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. When issuing a request to perform a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token. Otherwise, the server will refuse to perform the requested action.

A **common way to share CSRF tokens with the client is to include them as a hidden parameter in an HTML form**.

Example request,

```http
<form name="change-email-form" action="/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
    <label>Email</label>
    <input required type="email" name="email" value="example@normal-website.com">
    <input required type="hidden" name="csrf" value="50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8taR1k3ODOR8d6u">
    <button class='button' type='submit'> Update email </button>
</form>
```

> CSRF tokens don't have to be sent as hidden parameters in a POST request. **Some applications place CSRF tokens in HTTP headers**, for example. The way
> in which tokens are transmitted has a significant impact on the security of a mechanism as a whole.
