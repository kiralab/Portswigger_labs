## Overview :

One of the more obvious ways of preventing users from uploading malicious scripts is to blacklist potentially dangerous file extensions like .php. The practice of blacklisting is inherently flawed as it's difficult to explicitly block every possible file extension that could be used to execute code. Such blacklists can sometimes be bypassed by using lesser known, alternative file extensions that may still be executable, such as .php5, .shtml, and so on.
